https://fooddrive-n3wvgvcyeamjdwt8wu2pff.streamlit.app/

this is the link for the app.
after collecting the data following the timeline we are atthe stage of creating an app
we went through cleaning the data manually.
later cleaned tbe data by python.
Moreover we tried model on different algorithm. Out of which random forest was proven the best.
We learned to delopy app throgh streamlit.
following what we leart we uploaded all the files we got from the above steps i mentioned.
we changed the code and fill some information which we particularly want app to show us.
i personally found it difficult to deloy and was facing error agaim and agaim.
